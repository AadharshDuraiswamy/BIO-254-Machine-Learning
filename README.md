# BIO-254-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning to distinguish benign and malignant breast cancer tumors from patient records. We later trained a machine to predict whether a patient had a non-recurring or recurring cancerous tumor.
The include Python script is used to train the machine.
The R script is used for statistical analysis. T-Tests are used to compare means between different variable in the same dataset. Tests with alpha values greater than 0.05 are considered too close to use in the machine learning algorithm and are omitted
